# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# t.string :name
# t.text :description
# t.integer :price_in_cents

Product.create({name: "Travel Mug", description: "For the cold and lonely.", price_in_cents: 30})
